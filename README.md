# Three Axis Gimbal Stabilizer

## Introduction

The goal of this project was to design and develop a gimbal system capable of stabilizing a platform based on input from an accelerometer/magnetometer sensor and to demonstrate knowledge of aerospace concepts (namely aircraft principal axes and how to calculate their orientations from accelerometer readings) and ability to apply them in a hands-on project. In aerospace, a gimbal stabilizer can be used to control the orientation of any platform or instrument where the orientation must be independent of the orientation of the aircraft, such as in a camera or targeting system.

## Theory

The orientation of an aircraft can be expressed in terms of a series of rotations relative to a local coordinate system (generally with the x, y, and z, axes pointing north, east, and down, respectively, at some location on the Earth).
