# Three Axis Gimbal Stabilizer

## Introduction

The goal of this project was to design and develop a gimbal system capable of stabilizing a platform based on input from an accelerometer/magnetometer sensor and to demonstrate knowledge of aerospace concepts (namely aircraft principal axes and how to calculate them from accelerometers) and ability to apply them in a hands-on project. In aerospace, a gimbal stabilizer can be used to control the orientation of any platform or instrument where the orientation must be independent of the orientation of the aircraft, such as in a camera or targeting system.
